### Problem Statement:
Imagine you are developing the backend for an EdTech platform that aims to host virtual classrooms. Your task is to create a terminal-based Virtual Classroom Manager that handles class scheduling, student attendance, and assignment submissions.

The Virtual Classroom Manager is a terminal-based backend application designed to simulate the key operations of a virtual classroom within an EdTech platform. The application allows users to manage classrooms, students, and assignments via a simple command-line interface (CLI). It supports core functionalities like classroom creation, student enrollment, assignment scheduling, and submission handling.

This project is intended as a backend solution for managing virtual classrooms in an educational platform, with a focus on clean code practices, SOLID principles, and maintainable design patterns.

## Features
- Classroom Management: Create, list, and delete classrooms to organize virtual educational spaces.
- Student Enrollment: Add students to classrooms, list enrolled students, and manage student attendance.
- Assignment Management: Schedule assignments for classrooms and allow students to submit their completed work.
- User Authentication: Secure the system with user authentication, ensuring only authorized personnel can manage classrooms and assignments.
